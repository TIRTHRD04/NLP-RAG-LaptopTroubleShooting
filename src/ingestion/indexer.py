# src/ingestion/indexer.py
"""
Vector database indexer for the RAG ingestion pipeline.

Handles connection to Qdrant, collection creation, and batch uploading
of embedding vectors with metadata.

Key Features:
- Auto-creates collection if it doesn't exist
- Batch uploading with tqdm progress
- Graceful error handling (logs failures, continues pipeline)
- Timing logs for connection & upload
